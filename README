This tool looks for constructors for numeric arrays in C# .NET sources files and reports them.

Background: We used this tool to quickly analyze the code of a large application which gets an input, works on large
numeric arrays, outputs the results and repeats the whole procedure thousands of times. Developers were encouraged
to use buffers or pools to avoid large array allocation in every cycle. To confirm that this is always the case
we were interested in the code locations where arrays are created. Our refactoring tools and IDE didn't have a feature 
to do that. A regex would have been an option but we were also interested to learn if we can use NRefactory to implement checks based on source code analysis.
